May I know the reason why u downloaded the txt file?

You 2:18 PM
was doing a udemy course. in that resources that file was there. I clicked it , then it tried to download

Mahadevan K 2:18 PM
What was the course name btw?

You 2:19 PM
It was on Penetration testing

Mahadevan K 2:19 PM
ok.
I'd suggest not to practice pentesting with our office laptop
tools that the course suggest cant be used in our environment and it raises unnecessary concern

You 2:21 PM
oh ok sure.  actually I was not doing pentesting..  I was just going through the course
in that resource material this file was there.

Mahadevan K 2:21 PM
feel free to learn the course but not advisable to download any contents
Ok no problem, thanks for the support.

You 2:21 PM
oh ok sure.  got it . thanks
