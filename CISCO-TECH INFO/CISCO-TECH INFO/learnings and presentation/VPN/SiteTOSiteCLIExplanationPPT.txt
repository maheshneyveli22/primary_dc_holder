Steps to configure a Site  to Site VPN:
Step 1:Configure ACLS:
This step defines interesting traffic that needs to be encrypted and that has to be protected by tunnel
Eg: access-list 101 permit ip any any
Step 2:Configure ISAKMP Policy(IKE Phase 1 Negotiation):
This configuration sets up tunnel and configures isakmp parameters for establishing tunnel between two devices
Eg: crypto isakmp policy 1
authentication pre-share
encryption aes
hash md5
group 2
lifetime 86400
crypto isakmp key cisco address 192.168.100.3

Steps to configure a Site  to Site VPN:
Step 3:Configure Transform Set(IKE Phase 2)
This step involves, configuring encryption standards for actual ipsec traffic between two devices
Transform set is for protecting the actual data
Eg: crypto ipsec transform-set  tsName1 esp-3des esp-md5-hmac
Step 4:Create Crypto Map
This step involves, creating a profile
Here we specify which peer device, the access list, transform set in a single profile.
Eg: Router(config)#  crypto map map1 1 ipsec-isakmp
Router(config-crypto-map)# set peer 192.168.100.3
Router(config-crypto-map)# match address 101
Router(config-crypto-map)# set transform-set tsName1



Steps to configure a Site  to Site VPN:
Step 5: Apply Crypto map to interface:
The crypto map created is applied on the interface
Eg: crypto ipsec transform-set  tsName1 esp-3des esp-md5-hmac
Router(config)#  int fa0/0
fa0/0 is the interface
Router(config-if)# crypto map map1
Caveats in Configuration:
The Configuration of devices must mirror each other
while configuring isakmp, whatever is given for device 1 should match device 2, else tunnel wont be created
Can configure multiple ipsec transform sets for a device, but between two devices ipsec parameters encryption and integrity needs to be the same
if isakmp matches and ipsec does not match, tunnel will be created, but during actual traffic error will be encountered
