Clientless SSL VPN End User Setup
This section is for the system administrator who sets up Clientless SSL VPN for end users. It describes how to customize the end-user interface.

This section summarizes configuration requirements and tasks for a remote system. It specifies information to communicate to users to get them started using Clientless SSL VPN. It includes the following topics:

Defining the End User Interface
Customizing Clientless SSL VPN Pages
Information About Customization
Exporting a Customization Template
Editing the Customization Template
Defining the End User Interface
The
Clientless SSL VPN end user interface consists of a series of HTML panels. A user logs on to Clientless SSL VPN by entering the IP address of an ASA interface in the format https:// address . The first panel that displays is the login screen (Figure 21-1).

Figure 21-1
Clientless SSL VPN Login Screen

 


Viewing the Clientless SSL VPN Home Page
After the user logs in, the portal page opens.

The home page displays all of the Clientless SSL VPN features you have configured, and its appearance reflects the logo, text, and colors you have selected. This sample home page includes all available Clientless SSL VPN features with the exception of identifying specific file shares. It lets users browse the network, enter URLs, access specific websites, and use Application Access (port forwarding and smart tunnels) to access TCP applications.

Viewing the Clientless SSL VPN Application Access Panel
To start port forwarding or smart tunnels, a user clicks the Go button in the Application Access box. The
Application Access window opens (Figure 21-2).

Figure 21-2 Clientless SSL VPN Application Access Window

 


This window displays the TCP applications configured for this Clientless SSL VPN connection. To use an application with this panel open, the user starts the application in the normal way.


NoteA stateful failover does not retain sessions established using Application Access. Users must reconnect following a failover.

Viewing the Floating Toolbar
The
floating toolbar shown in Figure 21-3 represents the current Clientless SSL VPN session.

Figure 21-3
Clientless SSL VPN Floating Toolbar

 


Be aware of the following characteristics of the floating toolbar:

The toolbar lets you enter URLs, browse file locations, and choose preconfigured Web connections without interfering with the main browser window.
If you configure your browser to block popups, the floating toolbar cannot display.
If you close the toolbar, the ASA prompts you to end the Clientless SSL VPN session.
Customizing Clientless SSL VPN Pages
You can change the appearance of the portal pages displayed to Clientless SSL VPN users. This includes the Login page displayed to users when they connect to the security appliance, the Home page displayed to users after the security appliance authenticates them, the Application Access window displayed when users launch an application, and the Logout page displayed when users log out of Clientless SSL VPN sessions.

After you customize the portal pages, you can save your customization and apply it to a specific connection profile, group policy, or user. The changes do not take effect until you reload the ASA, or you switch off and then enable clientless SSL.

You can create and save many customization objects, enabling the security appliance to change the appearance of portal pages for individual users or groups of users.

This section includes the following topics:

Information About Customization
Exporting a Customization Template
Editing the Customization Template
Importing a Customization Object
Applying Customizations to Connection Profiles, Group Policies and Users
Login Screen Advanced Customization
Information About Customization
The ASA uses customization objects to define the appearance of user screens. A customization object is compiled from an XML file which contains XML tags for all the customizable screen items displayed to remote users. The ASA software contains a customization template that you can export to a remote PC. You can edit this template and import the template back into the ASA as a new customization object.

When you export a customization object, an XML file containing XML tags is created at the URL you specify. The XML file created by the customization object named Template contains empty XML tags, and provides the basis for creating new customization objects. This object cannot be changed or deleted from cache memory but can be exported, edited, and imported back into the ASA as a new customization object.

Customization Objects, Connection Profiles, and Group Policies

Initially, when a user first connects, the default customization object (named DfltCustomization ) identified in the connection profile (tunnel group) determines how the logon screen appears. If the connection profile list is enabled, and the user selects a different group which has its own customization, the screen changes to reflect the customization object for that new group.

After the remote user is authenticated, the screen appearance is determined by whether a customization object that has been assigned to the group policy.

Exporting a Customization Template
When you export a customization object, an XML file is created at the URL you specify. The customization template (named Template ) contains empty XML tags and provides the basis for creating new customization objects. This object cannot be changed or deleted from cache memory but can be exported, edited, and imported back into the ASA as a new customization object.

DETAILED STEPS

Command
Purpose
Step 1
export webvpn customization
Exports a customization object and allows you to make changes to the XML tags.
Step 2
import webvpn customization
 
hostname# export webvpn customization DfltCustomization tftp://209.165.200.225/dflt_custom
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!INFO: Customization object 'DfltCustomization' was exported to tftp://10.86.240.197/dflt_custom
hostname#
Imports the file as a new object.
Exports the default customization object (DfltCustomization) and creates the XML file named dflt_custom .
Editing the Customization Template
This section shows the contents of the customization template and has convenient figures to help you quickly choose the correct XML tag and make changes that affect the screens.

You can use a text editor or an XML editor to edit the XML file. The following example shows the XML tags of the customization template. Some redundant tags have been removed for easier viewing:

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
329994 bytes copied in 5.350 secs (65998 bytes/sec)
Imports an XML file into cache memory of the ASA. When you import the customization object, the ASA checks the XML code for validity. If the code is valid, the ASA stores the object in a hidden location in cache memory.
Imports the customization object General.xml from the URL 209.165.201.22/customization and names it custom1 .
Applying Customizations to Connection Profiles, Group Policies and Users
After you create a customization, you can apply the customization to a connection profile (tunnel group), a group, or a user, with the customization command. The options displayed with this command are different depending on the mode you are in.


NoteAfter you customize the portal pages, the changes do not take effect until you reload the ASA, or you disable and then enable clientless SSL.

For more information about configuring connection profiles, group policies, and users, see Chapter4, “Configuring Connection Profiles, Group Policies, and Users”.

Login Screen Advanced Customization
If you prefer to use your own, custom login screen, rather than changing specific screen elements of the login screen we provide, you can perform this advanced customization using the Full Customization feature.

With Full Customization, you provide the HTML for your own login screen, and you insert Cisco HTML code that calls functions on the ASA that create the Login form and the Language Selector drop-down list.

This section describes the modifications you need to make to your HTML code and the tasks required to configure the ASA to use your code.

Figure 21-8 shows the standard Cisco login screen that displays to Clientless SSL VPN users. The Login form is displayed by a function called by the HTML code.

Figure 21-8

</table>
 
The indented code injects the Login form and the Language Selector on the screen. The function csco_ShowLoginForm('lform') injects the logon form. csco_ShowLanguageSelector('selector') injects the Language Selector.

Modifying Your HTML File
DETAILED STEPS


Step 1   Name your file logon.inc. When you import the file, the ASA recognizes this filename as the logon screen.
Step 2 Modify the paths of images used by the file to include /+CSCOU+/.

Files that are displayed to remote users before authentication must reside in a specific area of the ASA cache memory represented by the path /+CSCOU+/. Therefore, the source for each image in the file must include this path. For example:

src=”/+CSCOU+/asa5520.gif”
 
Step 3 Insert the special HTML code below. This code contains the Cisco functions, described earlier, that inject the login form and language selector onto the screen.

<body onload="csco_ShowLoginForm('lform');csco_ShowLanguageSelector('selector')">
 
<table>
 
<tr><td colspan=3 height=20 align=right><div id="selector" style="width: 300px"></div></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr>
<td height="379"></td>
<td height="379"></td>

Customizing Bookmark Help
The ASA displays help content on the application panels for each selected bookmark. You can customize those help files or create help files in other languages. You then import them to flash memory for display during subsequent sessions. You can also retrieve previously imported help content files, modify them, and reimport them to flash memory.

Each application panel displays its own help file content using a predetermined filename. The prospective location of each is in the /+CSCOE+/help/ language / URL within flash memory of the ASA. Table 21-1 shows the details about each of the help files you can maintain for VPN sessions.

Open Internet Explorer and choose Tools > Internet Options > Languages > Add .
Open Mozilla Firefox and choose Tools > Options > Advanced > General , click Choose next to Languages, and click Select a language to add .
The following sections describe how to customize the help contents:

Customizing a Help File Provided By Cisco
Creating Help Files for Languages Not Provided by Cisco
Importing a Help File to Flash Memory
Exporting a Previously Imported Help File from Flash Memory
Customizing a Help File Provided By Cisco
To customize a help file provided by Cisco, you need to get a copy of the file from the flash memory card first. Get the copy and customize it as follows:

DETAILED STEPS

Step 1 Use your browser to establish a Clientless SSL VPN session with the ASA.

Step 2 Display the help file by appending the string in “URL of Help File in Flash Memory of the Security Appliance” in Table 21-1 , to the address of the ASA, then press Enter.


Note Enter en in place of language to get the help file in English.

The following example address displays the English version of the Terminal Servers help:

https:// address_of_security_appliance /+CSCOE+/help/en/rdp-hlp.inc

Step 3 Choose File > Save (Page) As .


Note Do not change the contents of the File name box.

Step 4 Change the Save as type option to Web Page, HTML only and click Save .

Step 5 Use your preferred HTML editor to modify the file.


Note You can use most HTML tags, but do not use tags that define the document and its structure (e.g., do not use <html>, <title>, <body>, <head>, <h1>, <h2>, etc. You can use character tags, such as the <b> tag, and the <p>, <ol>, <ul>, and <li> tags to structure content.

Step 6 Save the file as HTML only, using the original filename and extension.

Step 7 Ensure the filename matches the one in Table 21-1 , and that it does not have an extra filename extension.


 
Creating Help Files for Languages Not Provided by Cisco
Use HTML to create help files in other languages.

We recommend creating a separate folder for each language to support.

Save the file as HTML only. Use the filename following the last slash in “URL of Help File in Flash Memory of the Security Appliance” in Table 21-1 .

See the next section to import the files for display during VPN sessions.

Restrictions

You can use most HTML tags, but do not use tags that define the document and its structure (e.g., do not use <html>, <title>, <body>, <head>, <h1>, <h2>, etc. You can use character tags, such as the <b> tag, and the <p>, <ol>, <ul>, and <li> tags to structure content.

The ASA includes a translation table template for each domain that is part of standard functionality. The templates for plug-ins are included with the plug-ins and define their own translation domains.

You can export the template for a translation domain, which creates an XML file of the template at the URL you provide. The message fields in this file are empty. You can edit the messages and import the template to create a new translation table object that resides in flash memory.

You can also export an existing translation table. The XML file created displays the messages you edited previously. Reimporting this XML file with the same language name creates a new version of the translation table object, overwriting previous messages.

Some templates are static, but some change based on the configuration of the ASA. Because you can customize the logon and logout pages, portal page, and URL bookmarks for clientless users, the ASA generates the customization and url-list translation domain templates dynamically, and the template automatically reflects your changes to these functional areas.

After creating translation tables, they are available to customization objects that you create and apply to group policies or user attributes. With the exception of the AnyConnect translation domain, a translation table has no affect, and messages are not translated on user screens until you create a customization object, identify a translation table to use in that object, and specify that customization for the group policy or user. Changes to the translation table for the AnyConnect domain are immediately visible to AnyConnect client users.

Creating Translation Tables
You can create translation tables in both single context mode and multi-context mode:

Shows a portion of the template that was exported as portal . The end of this output includes a message ID field (msgid) and a message string field (msgstr) for the message which is displayed on the portal page when a user establishes a Clientless SSL VPN session. The complete template contains many pairs of message fields.
Step 3
import webvpn translation-table
 
hostname# import webvpn translation-table customization language es-us tftp://209.165.200.225/portal
hostname# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hostname# show import webvpn translation-table
Translation Tables' Templates:
AnyConnect
PortForwarder
csd
customization
keepout
url-list
webvpn
Citrix-plugin
RPC-plugin
Telnet-SSH-plugin
VNC-plugin
 
Translation Tables:
es-us customization
 
Imports the translation table.
Import the XML file. es-us is the abbreviation for Spanish spoken in the United States.
If you import a translation table for the AnyConnect domain, your changes are effective immediately. If you import a translation table for any other domain, you must create a customization object, identify the translation table to use in that object, and specify that customization object for the group policy or user.

Referencing the Language in a Customization Object
This section describes how to export the customization template, edit it, and import it as a customization object so that you can refer to it.

Prerequisites

For the customization object to call these translation tables correctly, the tables must have been previously imported using the same names. These names must be compatible with language options of the browser.

DETAILED STEPS

Command
Function
Step 1
export webvpn customization template
 
hostname# export webvpn customization template tftp://209.165.200.225/sales
Exports a customization template to a URL where you can edit it.
Exports the template and creates the copy sales at the URL specified.
Step 2
Edit the customization template and reference the previously-imported translation table
 
<localization>
<languages>en,ja,zh,ru,ua</languages>
<default-language>en</default-language>
</localization>
 
 
 
 
 
<auth-page>
....
<language-selector>
<mode>enable</mode>
<title l10n="yes">Language:</title>
<language>
<code>en</code>
<text>English</text>
</language>
<language>
<code>es-us</code>
<text>Spanish</text>
</language>
</language-selector>
 
Two areas of XML code in the customization template pertain to translation tables.
Specifies the translation table to use.
The <languages> tag in the XML code is followed by the names of the translation tables. In this example, they are en, ja, zh, ru, and ua.
The <default-language> tag specifies the language that the remote user first encounters when connecting to the ASA. In the example code above, the language is English.
Affects the display of the Language Selector and includes the <language selector> tag and the associated <language> tags that enable and customize the Language Selector:
The <language-selector> group of tags includes the <mode> tag that enables and disables the displaying of the Language Selector and the <title> tag that specifies the title of the drop-down box listing the languages.
The <language> group of tags includes the <code> and <text> tags that map the language name displayed in the Language Selector drop-down box to a specific translation table.
Step 3
Save the file after making your changes.
 
Step 4
import webvpn customization
 
hostname# import webvpn customization sales tftp://209.165.200.225/sales
hostname# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Imports the customization template as a new object.
Step 5
show import webvpn customization
 
hostname# import webvpn customization sales tftp://209.165.200.225/sales
hostname# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Shows the new customization object sales .
