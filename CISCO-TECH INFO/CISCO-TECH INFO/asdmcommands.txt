Prashant Chaturvedi-X(praschat - HCL TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED at Cisco)  
looks like you are using a very old version of the launcher which is not compatable with java 1.7 10:44 AM 
Please install the latest version of the launcher or use webstart for accessing the ASDM 10:44 AM 
 
Maheswaran Elumalai-X(maelumal - HCL TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED at Cisco)  
ok then. I need to install webstart first? 10:45 AM 
Or do you have the latest version? 10:45 AM 
of launcher 10:45 AM 
 
Prashant Chaturvedi-X(praschat - HCL TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED at Cisco)  
Just navigate to https://<dev-ip> and you will be given the option to install the launcher or launch ASDM via webstart. Since you already have the JDK installed, chances are that you might already have webstart 10:46 AM 
 
Maheswaran Elumalai-X(maelumal - HCL TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED at Cisco)  
i did like that only and installed asdm 10:47 AM 
 
Prashant Chaturvedi-X(praschat - HCL TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED at Cisco)
