3) curl with auth token:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer b1094abc0-54a4-3eab-7213-877142c33fh3" http://example.com/

4) curl with pwd:
curl --user baeldung:secretPassword http://example.com/

5) Custom Headers
We can replace the default headers or add headers of our own.

For instance, to change the Host header, we do this:

curl -H "Host: com.baeldung" http://example.com/
Copy
To switch off the User-Agent header, we put in an empty value:

curl -H "User-Agent:" http://example.com/
Copy
The most common scenario while testing is changing the Content-Type and Accept header. We just have to prefix each header with the -H option:

curl -d @request.json -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
  -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8082/spring-rest/foos/new
  
6) DELETE
Again, we specify that we want to use DELETE by using the -X option:

curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8082/spring-rest/foos/9


7) PUT
This method is very similar to POST, but we use it when we want to send a new version of an existing resource. In order to do this, we use the -X option.

curl -d @request.json -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 
  -X PUT http://localhost:8082/spring-rest/foos/9
