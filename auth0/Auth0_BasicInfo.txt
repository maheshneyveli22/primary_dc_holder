1) Auth0 Dashboard: 

a) Applications :
Manage your applications, APIs, and single sign-on (SSO) integrations.
-> Applications: For each of your apps for which you want to authenticate users with Auth0, register an application.
-> APIs: For each of your APIs that you want to secure with Auth0, register an API. Create new APIs and manage existing ones.
-> SSO Integrations: View and enable external services for SSO. Create new SSO integrations and configure, review, and manage integration settings.

b) Authentication	
-> Manage the identity providers through which you allow users to authenticate to your apps.
-> Database: Securely store and manage username/password credentials either in an Auth0 datastore or in your own database. Connect to existing databases using template-based JavaScript scripts that run on Auth0's server during every authentication. Gradually migrate an existing database of legacy credentials to Auth0 as users authenticate (no password reset required).
-> Social: Configure social identity providers (such as Facebook, X, and Github) through which your users can log in.
-> Enterprise: Configure enterprise identity providers (such as Active Directory, SAML, and Office 365) through which your users can log in using their enterprise credentials.
-> Passwordless: Allow your users to sign up and log in using one-time passcodes (delivered by email or SMS) or one-click links, instead of passwords.

c) Organizations	
-> Manage the organizations you do business with, and customize the experience their users have when accessing your applications.

d) User Management	Manage your users' identities and permissions.
-> Users: View and create user profiles, perform password resets, block and delete users, and more.
-> Roles: Create and manage roles for your apps. Roles contain collections of permissions and can be assigned to users.

e) Branding	
-> Universal Login: Create and customize a login page to which you can direct users to authenticate.
Custom Domains: Create a custom domain to maintain a consistent experience for your users.
Email Templates: Use templates to create welcome, password reset, and account verification email-based workflows.
Email Provider: Designate and configure your custom email provider information.

f) Security:
-> Security	Configure extra layers of security by enabling shields that protect your users against different types of attacks and user access anomalies.
-> Attack Protection: Manage settings for bot, IP throttling, brute-force, and breached password attacks.
-> Multi-factor Auth: Require additional factors during the login process to prevent unauthorized access.
-> Monitoring: Monitor threat intelligence events with one of our data visualization and alerting integrations.

g) Actions	Configure flows such as login, machine-to-machine, user registration, and password resets. Create and manage customized actions used in flows.

h) Auth Pipeline	
Rules: 
-> Configure custom JavaScript snippets that are executed in Auth0 as part of each user authentication transaction. 
-> You can call external APIs, filter which users can log in to your application, use an AllowList, configure geolocated access, and so on.
Hooks: 
-> Customize the behavior of Auth0 when you use Database Connections by configuring Node.js code that is executed against extensibility points (which are comparable to webhooks that come with a server).

i) Monitoring	
-> Logs: View log data of actions taken in the dashboard by administrators and user logins.
-> Streams: Create and manage log event streaming to external data analysis services.


j) Marketplace	Explore integrations that help your business do more with Auth0.

k) Extensions	Extend the Auth0 platform with official and third-party add-ons.

l) Settings	Configure your tenants, manage your Auth0 subscription and payment options, control your tenant administrators and other user roles. 
-> Manage other tenant settings related to your custom domains, signing keys, and other advanced settings.

2) Activity Page:
a) About the Activity Page
The Activity page provides a summary of key data about your Auth0 tenant, including information on active users, failed logins, and more.

b) Things to know
Viewing a tenant's Activity page requires an account with an administrator role.

c) The Support Access role has limited access to the tenant's Activity page.

d) To ensure data is consistent, the current date cannot be selected in the date picker and data may take up to 12-24 hours to display.

e) Metrics
Hereâ€™s what you will see on your tenant's Activity page.

-> Totals
At the top of the page, you'll see your tenant's total number of users, applications, APIs, and connections.


-> Daily Active Users
The number of daily unique users with successful authentication or authorization activity. You can see the number of unique users for each day by hovering your mouse over a point in the graph.

-> User Retention
The percentage of users that were active during the given time frame, calculated from the number of active users out of the total number of users on the tenant.


-> Signups
The number of successful user signups.

-> Failed Logins
The number of failed user logins (the f log event type) over the given time period.


-> Compare to last period
When Compare to last period is enabled:
-> The percentage difference is included in the graph. Positive changes are colored green while negative changes are colored red.

-> View data by time frame
You can view data for a given time frame by using the datepicker next to the Compare to last period checkbox. There are builtin date ranges for the last 7/14/30/60 days, or you can provide the From and To dates for a custom range.
