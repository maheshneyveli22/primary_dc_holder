1) Spring security protects against Cross-Site Request forgery(CSRF)

2) what is CSRF
-> Security attack where an evil website tricks you into executing an action on a web application that you are currently logged into

3) Spring Security's CSRF protection:

-> CSRF  protection enabled by default in spring security.
-> Spring security uses Synchronizer token pattern
* Each request includes a session cookie and randomly generated token
-> for request processing, spring security verifies token before processing
-> All these handled by Spring security filters

4) When to use CSRF protection?
->for any normal browser web requests
-> For non browser clients, you may disable csrf protection(after careful review)

5) For Form submissions, use POST instead of GET
* Include CSRF token in form submission

<form:form> automatically adds CSRF token

-> if<form:form> is not used, we need to manually add csrf token
