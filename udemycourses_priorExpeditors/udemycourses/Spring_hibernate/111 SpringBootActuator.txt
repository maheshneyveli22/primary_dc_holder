PROBLEM:
1) How can i monitor and manage my application
2) How can i check my application health?
3) How can i access application metrics?

SOLUTION: Use SPring boot Actuator

SPRING BOOT ACTUATOR
1) It exposes end points to monitor and manage your application
* Easily get devops functionality out of the box
* Simply add dependancy to your pom file
2) Rest Points are then added automatically to your application
3) No additional code needed.

4) Dependancy to add in pom.xml to enable spring boot actuator
	<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
		</dependency>
		
		
5) Spring automatically exposes endpoints for metrics out of the box.
-> End points are prefixed with:/actuator

/health -> health information about your application
/info -> information about your project



6) Health Endpoint

/health - Checks status of your application
-> Normally used by monitoring apps to see if your app is up or down

eg: 
localhost:8080/actuator/health
{"status":"UP"}

7) Health status is customizable based on your own business logic


8) Info

/info gives information about your application
* Default is empty

localhost:8080/actuator/info

{}

-> to customize the information, update application.properties with your app info

eg:

info.app.name= My super cool app	
info.app.description= Crazy cool app	
info.app.version= 1.0.0

9) Hence properties starting with "info" will be used by /info endpoint


10) Spring boot actuator endpoints
->10+ available

a) /auditevents - Audit events for your application
b) /beans - List of all beans registered in the spring application context
c) /mappings - List of all @RequestMapping paths


11) EXPOSING ENDPOINTS
-> By default only /health is exposed
-> To expose all actuator endpoints over http, use wildcard "*" to expose all endpoints in application.properties
-> Can also expose individual endpoints with a comma-delimited list

eg:
management.endpoints.web.exposur.include=*

or 
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info
management.info.env.enabled=true


12) Get a list of beans:

13) http://localhost:8080/actuator/beans
14) http://localhost:8080/actuator/threadump
-> for analysing and profiling application's performance
15) http://localhost:8080/actuator/mappings -> gets list of all the request mappings for your app
