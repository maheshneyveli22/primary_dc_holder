7) FLOW
1) Everything starts with the first incoming request
2) Incoming request encounters with FrontController
-> Also known as dispatcher servlet
-> Part of spring framework
-> DIspatcher Servlet or front controller delegates the request to other objects or items in our system
3) As a developer we will create
-> Model Objects
-> View Templates
-> Controller classes
4) CONTROLLER 
-> Code created by developer
-> Contains business logic
* Handles request
* Store/retrieve data(db,web service..)
* Place data in model
-> Send to appropriate view template 
5) MODEL 
-> Contains data
-> Store/retrieve data via backend systems
* DB, web service etc
* Use Spring bean if you like
-> Place your data in model
* Data can be any Java object/Collection
6) VIEW TEMPLATE
-> Spring MVC supports many view templates
-> JSP+JSTL is most common
-> Developer creates a page and displays data
