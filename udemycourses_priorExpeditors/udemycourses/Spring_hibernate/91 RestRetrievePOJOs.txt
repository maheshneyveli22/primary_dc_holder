CREATE A NEW SERVICE

a) Return a list of students

GET /api/students Returns a list of students


b) Spring Rest service

Rest CLient--/api/students--->Rest SERVICE

-> this api request will return a list of students as json
-> We will write this code for the rest service on right side

c) Convert Java POJO to JSON
a)  Our rest service will return List<Student>
b) we need to conver List<Student> to JSON
c) Jackson can help on the to convert list of student pojos to JSON
d) As long as jackson project is on classpath or pom.xml, json data being passed to rest controller is converted to Java POJO
e) Similarly Java POJO being returned from REST controller is converted to JSON
