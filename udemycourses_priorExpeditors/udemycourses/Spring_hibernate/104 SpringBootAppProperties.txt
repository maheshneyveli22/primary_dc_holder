APPLICATION PROPERTIES

1) By default spring boot will load properties from: application.properties, this file will be present under sr/main/resources directory


2) application.properties file is created by spring initializer as empty at the beginning
-> we can add spring boot properties
server.port=8585
#Configure my properties
coach.name= Mickey Mouse
team.name= The Mouse Crew

-> so we say dont listen on port 8080 instead listen on 8585 port


3) How to read data from application.properties file?

@RestController
public class FunRestController
{
@Value("${coach.name}")
private String coachName;

@Value("${team.name}")
private String teamName;

}
