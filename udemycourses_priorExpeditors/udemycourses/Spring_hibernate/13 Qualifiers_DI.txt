1) During autowiring if an interface has multiple implementations, to specify which implementation to be used for DI, we use @Qualifier annotation and specify the bean id to be used.
-> in this case both @Autowired and @Qualifier annotation are used 

eg:

@Component
public class TennisCoach implements Coach
{
@Autowired
@Qualifier("happyFortuneService")
private FortuneService fortuneService;

.....

}

2) 
@Qualifier annotation can be used for
a) Constructor injection
b) Setter Injection
c) Field Injection
