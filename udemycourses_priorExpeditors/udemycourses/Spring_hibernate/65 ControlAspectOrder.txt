HOW TO CONTROL ORDER OF ADVICES BEING APPLIED, when they all match the same condition?

To control ORDER
1) Place advices in separate Aspects
2) Control order on Aspects using @Order annotation


3) Development process:
a) Place advices in separate aspect classes instead of having them in a single aspect class
b) Add @Order annotation to aspects

@Order(1)
public class MyCloudLogAspect
{
...
}

4) eg:

@Aspect
@Component
@Order(1)
public class MyCloudLogAspect
{
...
}

@Aspect
@Component
@Order(2)
public class MyLoggingDemoAspect
{
...
}

@Aspect
@Component
@Order(3)
public class MyApiAnalyticsAspect
{
...
}

5) Lower numbers are given higher precence

Range: Integer.MIN_Value to Integer.MAX_VALUE

6) Negative numbers are allowed

7) does not need to be consecutive

8) what happens if they have same order of annotation
-> that is undefined
