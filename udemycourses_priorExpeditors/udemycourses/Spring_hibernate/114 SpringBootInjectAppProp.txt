1) By default spring boot reads information from a standard properties file

-> located at: src/main/resources/application.properties

-> we can define any custom properties in this file.
-> spring boot app can access properties using @Value


2) Development process
a) Define custom properties in application.properties
eg:
src/main/resources/application.properties
#Define custom properties
coach.name= Mickey mouse
team.name= The Mouse club

b) Inject properties into spring boot application using @Value

@RestController
public class FunRestController
{
//inject properties for coach.name and team.name

@Value("$(coach.name}")
private String coachName;


@Value("$(team.name}")
private String teamName;

}
