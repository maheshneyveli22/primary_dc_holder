Hibernate Session Factory:
-> Hibernate session Factory needs a Data source
* THe data source defines database connection info


Customer DAO(data access object)<---->SessionFactory<---Data Source---->Database

-> all these dependencies will be wired via dependency injection



2) Spring @Transactional
-> Automatically begins and ends a transaction for hibernate
-> no need to explicitly mention in code for begin transaction, commit etc
