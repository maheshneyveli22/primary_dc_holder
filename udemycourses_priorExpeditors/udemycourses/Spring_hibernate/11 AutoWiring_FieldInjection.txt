FIELD INJECTION:
-> Inject dependencies by setting field values on your class directly(even private fields)
-> Accomplished by using java reflection


FIELD INJECTION - DEVELOPMENT PROCESS:

1) Configure dependancy injection with autowired annotation
-> applied directly to field
-> no need for setter methods


eg:
public class TennisCoach implements Coach
{
@Autowired
private FortuneService fortuneService;

public TennisCoach()
{

}

//Setter methods not needed

}
