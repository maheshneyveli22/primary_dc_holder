Spring Boot Starters

1) Spring Boot Starters are a curated list of Maven dependencies
-> collection of dependencies grouped together
-> Tested and verified by Spring development team
-> Makes it much easier for the developer to get started with spring
-> Reduces amount of maven configuration

2) In spring initializer we select web dependancy
-> on doing that, we automatically get spring-boot-starter-web in pom.xml

3) If we are building spring app that needs: web, security - then simply select the dependancy in the spring initializer
