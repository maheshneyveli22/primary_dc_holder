 IoC and DI with Java Configuration
Practice Activity #7 - Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection with Java Code

  Note: In this practice activity, do not use component scanning.

Create a new Coach implementation.
Create a new fortune service implementation (return a single hard-coded fortune)

Create a Java configuration class to perform IoC and DI with those classes.

Develop a main application to retrieve your coach implementation.
Test your application and verify your coach implementation is wired up as desired.
