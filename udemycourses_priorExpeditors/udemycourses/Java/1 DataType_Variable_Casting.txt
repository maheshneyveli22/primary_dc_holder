#1 Datatype
#2 Variable
#3 Type casting

1) 8 primitive data types
boolean: 1 bit
byte: 1 Byte
short: 2 Byte
char: 2 bytes
int:  4 Bytes
long: 8 Bytes
float: 4 bytes
double: 8 bytes

2) By default all variables are assigned with value int. 
-> if we need to move to other variable type, we should type cast it

Eg: 
		byte b = Byte.MIN_VALUE;
        System.out.println("Old value" + b);
        byte oldValue = Byte.MIN_VALUE;
        byte newValue = (byte) (oldValue / 2);
        System.out.println("newvalue"+newValue);
		
		
3) For storing small datatypes in higher datatypes, explicit casting is not required, but for putting big datatype value in small ones, explicit casting is required:

eg:    byte byteValue = 120;
        short shortValue = 2455;
        int intValue = 2344;
        long longValue = 50000 + 10 * (byteValue + shortValue + intValue);
        System.out.println("finalLongValue " + longValue);

      short newShortValue=(short)(10000+ 1*(byteValue+shortValue+intValue));
        System.out.println(newShortValue);
		
O/P:
finalLongValue 99190
14919		
		
		
4) Float is not the preferred data type to use.
   Double is the preferred data type to use
		
		Float can be represented as:         float f=5.25f; ->Preferred  or         float f=(float)5.25;
		-> Float precision upto 7 digits
		-> double precision upto 16 digits after dot. 
		
Eg: 
f value 1.6666666
d value 1.6666666666666667

Double is preferable: Though it occupies double space than float
a) Faster to process since Many computers in chip level have ability/functionality to deal with double numbers faster than the float
b) Java libraries that process math functions are written to process double and not float and return results as double
c) Hence double is used a lot in code

***Java treats double as floating point number, while int as default whole number


5) Float and double will be used for general floating point operations. But i cant be used for precise calculation requirements, due to a limitation on how floating point numbers are stored. 
---> Java has another class called Big decimal which can be used for precise calcuation requirements


6)Char should have been a single byte, but it occupies two byes because it allows to store unicode characters also

7) int double boolean most common data types
   long, char sometimes 
   float, short - rarely
   
8) Result = Result + 1 or Result++
   Resutl = Result + 2 or Result+=2
   
9) Ternary Operator:
-> Shortcut to assign one or two values to a variable depending on a given condition

eg: int ageOfClient=20;
    boolean is18Over= (ageOfClient==20)?true:false;
