PROBLEMS IN java.io File

1) Many methods in class dont throw exceptions or provide specific error messages on why they fail

eg: File.delete() which returns a boolean
-> if deletion fails , you cant tell if it was because file did not exist or application did not have permission to delete the file

2) File.rename() method works differently in different platforms - hence not portable across platforms

3) No support for Symbolic links


4) File class does not provide a way to get metadata about a file such as its permissions, its owner and other security information. metadata it does provide is retrieved inefficiently

5) Many file methods dont work well when working with lots of data.

eg: if you use the File class to request a list of all the files in a directory and if there are lot of files, method can hang

6) Since File class does not understand symbolic links, walking a directory tree is problematic
