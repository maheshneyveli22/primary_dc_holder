1) Collection Interface
--> Set, List, Queue,Deque
      |
	  |->Sorted Set
	  
	  
	  Map->Sorted Map
	  
2) Collection methods:

a) Collections.sort -> for sorting
b) Collections.binarySearch -> index of the object that was searched
c) Collections.reverse()	  -> to reverse the list 
d)   Collections.shuffle(seatCopy);-> to randomise the objects in the list 
e) COllections.min() and Collections.max() according to natural sort order
f) Collections.swap -> for swapping elements in list
	  
3)         List<Theatre.Seat> seatCopy = new ArrayList<>(theatre.seats);
-> here seats from theatre.seats is copied to seatCopy., 

-> they are two arraylists but they refer to tht esame objects. hence shallow copy

4)  Collections.copy(newList, theatre.seats);
   -> source,destination
   -> to copy from source to destination
