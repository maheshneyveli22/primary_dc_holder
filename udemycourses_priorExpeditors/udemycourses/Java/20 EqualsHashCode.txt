1) When key of hashmap has user defined object or if set has user defined objects, then the equals/hashcode should be overridden.
2) Problems if we dont override are:

they will use object's equal method for equal  comparison and will always return true

3)5 RULES FOR HASHCODE/EQUALS

1) Reflexive
2) Transitive
3) Symmetric
4) Consistent

4) Potential issue with equals and hashcode()

-> if A is superclass and B is subclass and if we have equals method in both A and B, then

B.equals(A) will be true, but A.equals(B) will return false.

-> to avoid this, subclass should not override equals method and we should mark super class equals method as final so that it cannot be overridden
