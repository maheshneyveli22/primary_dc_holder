1) Bufferred reader reads text from the input stream and buffers the characters into character array
2) Reading chunks of data from file is more efficient than reading just few characters at a time
-> because it takes time to seek and find exact sector or location in the diskspace
3) Default size of buffer is 8KB

4) Reading contents of a file:

try(BufferredReader dirLocation= new BufferredReader(new FileReader("locations.txt)))
{
 String input;

while((input=dirLocation.readLine())!=null)
{
String[] data=input.split(" ");

}
}


4) Writing contents to a file:

try(BufferedWriter writeFile= new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("locations.txt)))
{
 {
 writeFile.write("write the contents as string");
 }
 }
