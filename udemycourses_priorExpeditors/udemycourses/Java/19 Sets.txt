1) Sets
-> No Duplicates(Important differentiator)
-> No default ordering


2) Sets that have default ordering: Linked Hash set, Tree set

3) methods:

size()
isEmpty()
contains()

4) Getting an element from nth position is not possible
-> we can check if element exists
-> we can iterate over the elements in the set, but cant get element from a specific location


5) Using mutable objects as elements in set can cause problems and behaviour is undefined if changing an object needs equals comparisons

6) Similar to map cannot contain itself as a key
-> Set cannot be an element of itself

7) Best performing implementation of set : HashSet

8) As of Java8, HashSet implementation uses HashMap

9) When hashset is created, object is added as key and dummy object added as value
