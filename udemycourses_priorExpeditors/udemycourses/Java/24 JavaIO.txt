1) to write contents to a file:

FileWriter locFile= new FileWriter("locations.txt");
for(Location location: locations.values())
{
locFile.write(location.getLocationID()+","+location.getDescription());
}
locFile.close();


2) try with resources from Java7:
-> here we declare the file resource in try block itself 
-> no need for closing FileWriter, since the java nio handles it

try(FileWriter locFile = new FileWriter("locations.txt");
for(Location location: locations.values())
{
locFile.write(location.getLocationID()+","+location.getDescription());
}
