1. Important points on overriding
1. Only inherited methods can be overridden, in other words, methods can be overridden only in child classes
2. Constructors and private methods cannot be overridden
3. Methods that are final cant be overriden
4. A sub class can use super.methodName() to call the super class version of overridden method.
5. Must have same return type or child class return type
6.  Must not have a lower modifier but may have a higher modifier
7. Must not throw a new or broader checked exception 


2. STATIC Methods
-> declared using static modifier
-> cant access intance mthods and instance variables directly
-> Cant use 'this' keyword in static methods
-> when we see method that does not use instance variables, that method can be declared static


3. Instance methods;
-> instance methods can access instance methods and variables directly
-> instance methods can also access static methods and variables directly

4. Static Variables:
-> every instance of that class share the same static variable.
-> if changes are made to that variable, all other instances can see the effect of that change.
