1) To make union of two sets:A and B

a) Create third set C which will hold the union values, while creating C, pass A as parameter
b) then use set.addAll(B) to add elements of set B to set C



2) setA.retainAll(setC)
-> this will retain elements in set A, corresponding to set Create
-> basically it will return the intersection elements



3) to add words of a sentence to a set

a) get words array using String split method
b) then convert arrays to Arraylist using: Arrays.asList(stringArray)
c) then add this arraylist to set



4) if there are two sets A and B

-> if you want to remove all elements, which are present in setB from Set A, then

setA.removeAll(SetB)

-> Similarly, if you want to remove all elements, which are present in set A from Set B, then

setB.removeAll(SetA)


5) we can check if SetB is subset of setA, using containsAll method

setA.containsAll(setB)

-> it will return true, if all elements of B are in Arraylist
