1) hasNext is just a check and only next moves to the element

eg:  while(iterator.hasNext())
        {
            System.out.println("Visiting the place: "+iterator.next());
        }
		
2) previous and next 
-> we can go back and forth in both directions
---> Java has implemented linked list as doubly linked list
