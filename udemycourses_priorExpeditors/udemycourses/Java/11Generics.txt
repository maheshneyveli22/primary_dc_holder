1) To create generics class
 a) Class declaration should have type T declared eg; Team
 b) Team arraylist should have Type T declared
 c) add member for team should have Type T instead of Player
 
 2) Argument passed for type parameter can be either class or Interface
 
 3) Here in below example T extends Player . this is singlebound
 
 4) we can have multiple bounds also eg: public class Team<T extends Player & Coach & Management>
 -> so anything of type Player, Coach, Management can be added to the team.
  -> for multiple bounds,  there can be only one class. so Player can be a class and Coach and Management has to be interfaces
 -> for multiple bounds, class should be mentioned first and then the interfaces, else Java will throw error
 
 eg: To create custom generic class
