1) Using FileReader, FileWrite we read contents of file as character and then wrote them as characters
2) ByteStreams also known as Binary Data

3) Advantage of ByteStreams is that,we dont have to pass the data into various datatypes that were stored.
-> Reason is ByteStreams itself can be used to read write any of the primitive types like, int, double float byte etc

4) In Bytestream methodology, 
a) We use FileInputStream instead of FileReader and FileOutputStream instead of FileWriter
b) Buffering will be done via BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream

c) 
eg:
try(DataOutputStream locFile= new DataOutputStream(new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("locations.dat"))
{

for(Location location:locations.values())
{
locFile.writeInt(location.getLocationID());
locFile.writeUTF(location.getDescription());
System.out.println("Writing location "+location.getLocationID()+" : "+location.getDescription());
System.out.println("Writing "+(location.getExits().size()-1)+" exits"); 
locFile.writeInt(location.getExits().size()-1);

for(String direction: location.getExits().keyset())
{
if(!direction.equalsIgnoreCase("Q"))
{
System.out.println("\t\t"+direction+","+location.getExits().get(direction));
locFile.writeUTF(direction);
locFile.writeInt(location.getExits().get(direction));
}
}
}

}


5) Here we are writing the locations.dat file

6) while working with .dat files, ensure that the debugging information is updated properly
