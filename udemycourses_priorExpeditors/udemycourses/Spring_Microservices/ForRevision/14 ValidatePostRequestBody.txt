1) Now we are going to add validation for the entry parameters ie firstName,lastName etc should not be empty

2) To do validation we are going to use HibernateValidator and the prevalidation constraints

3) since we are using spring boot and added corresponding dependancy in pom.xml we dont need any additional libraries

4) what we need to do is to enable validation for our beans and add few annotations

5) in createUser method, just be @RequestBody annotation we will add another annotation @valid

6) now go to UserDetailsRequestModel and add the corresponding annotation


7) 
a) @Valid annotation should be in creatusermethod before request body
b) go to request model: UserDetailsRequestModel and add not null and other annotations for validation
