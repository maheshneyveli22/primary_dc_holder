1) Eureka Discovery Service is also called: Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka, since Netflix were the first to build and use Eureka

2) Initially EUreka was used by Netflix for their own needs. Later Eureka became part of Spring Cloud.

3) What does Eureka do?
Eureka helps microservices to find each other


4) Whenever new instances of microservices starts up, it registers itself with Eureka
-> when we stop microservices, they will be removed from Eureka 
-> we need not update configuration files manually, this helps in scaling up your application and also scale down without interruption
-> API Gateway and Load balancer also part of our architecture



                                                                |--> Products Micoservice1(http://localhost:8080)
Mobile App[Client] -->                  API Gateway--->Eureka --|--> Products Micoservice2(http://localhost:8081)
                                                                |--> Products Micoservice3(http://localhost:8082)
																
																
																
5) Eureka service will tell API gateway about the location of each instance of product microservices

6) Client application will contact api gateway and then it will be able to contact respective product microservices

7) Load balancer of API gateway will balance the load between instances
