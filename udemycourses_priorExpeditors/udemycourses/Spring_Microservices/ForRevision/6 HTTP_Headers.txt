1) when we send a request to create a user profile, User details that are being sent are included in request body and this information about the user profile is well structured in the JSON format

2) Once server side script receives this information, it should be able to take the json text and convert it to Java object

3) for server side script to convert this json text  to java object  - it needs to know how to convert  or it needs to know what type of content that the http request carry in its body
Is it XML format or JSON format or Plain text?

4) so in addition to user details, http request should contain the type of content it carries in the http request

5) to do that we can use *****content type***** http header

6) in postman under content type , we can see different types of content. in that we can chose the content type we need. 


7) When service side of webservice responds back to our request, it can send us some additional information.

eg: user profile details or a list of all users if we send the request to get list of all users

-> And this information can also be structured in a different format. Eg: it can be JSON or XML 

8) So to tell server side, which content type we expect back and we can accept - we use a different HTTP head and it is called *****Accept*****

9) for this also we can provide option for accept as json or anything based on need similar to content type
