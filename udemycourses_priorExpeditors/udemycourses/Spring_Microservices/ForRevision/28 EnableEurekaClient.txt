1) Open PhotoAppApiUsersApplication class and add annotation to enable Eureka Client: @EnableDiscoveryClient

eg: @SpringBootApplication
@EnableDiscoveryClient
public class PhotoAppApiUsersApplication {

-> This annotation will make spring boot application as a client which will communicate with the discovery server

2) Go to application.properties and add following configuration details


server.port=0
spring.application.name=users-ws
eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone=http://localhost:8010/eureka
spring.devtools.restart.enabled=true


a) server.port=0  -> here server port is mentioned zero, since we want a random port number to be assigned  to this application
b) spring.application.name=users-ws -> name by which application will be known
                                    -> this name will be registered in eureka discovery server dashboard
c) eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone=http://localhost:8010/eureka -> Fully qualified name by which Eureka client communicate with discovery server
d) spring.devtools.restart.enabled=true  -> this will help automatically restart and redeploy,  when we change java code
