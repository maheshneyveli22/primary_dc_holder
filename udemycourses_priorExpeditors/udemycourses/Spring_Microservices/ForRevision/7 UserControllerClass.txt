1) Create Rest controller and add 4 simple methods that will accept http request and will send out some information

2) Create a controller package which holds all the rest controllers

3) Create a new class: UserController

4) when spring boot application starts and for this class to be able to accept http requests, we need to add two important annotations:

a) @RestController  
-> This annotation will register this class as a rest controller
-> now the class will be able to receive http request when a matching url request is sent by client

b) @RequestMapping
-> when http request is sent, it is sent to a certain url and that url contains path


5) Add a new method to getUser()
-> to make this method respond for get requests, add a new annotation 
-> @GetMapping

6) Similarly add method for createUser and update with annotation : @PostMapping

7) Create new method for updateUser and update with annotation @PutMapping

8) Create new method for deleteUser and update with annotation @DeleteMapping

9) then we can run in spring tool and check in postman if the service is running
