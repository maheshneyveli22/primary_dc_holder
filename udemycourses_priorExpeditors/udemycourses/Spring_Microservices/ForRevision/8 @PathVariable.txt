1) So far we have created HTTP requests for users to handle get,post,put,delete.
2) suppose if we want to get details of a particular user or update a particular user or delete it, we need to provide id of particular user in the uri
3) this userid going to be passed in uri is going to be a path variable

4) as of now, entire UserController class has only binding i.e @RequestMapping("users")//http://localhost:8080/users

-> entire class is mapped to /users and will be associated with a http request

5) to create binding if user id is passed along with users:

//http://localhost:8080/users/234443xxx

--> we need to update the @GetMapping annotation with PathVariable
----> so now we have created a binding that will bind this method getUser to a uri which will start with /users/ and with /somevalue

--> Annotation to be added:
@Get(path="/{useID}")

6) at this point we will have binding, but we need to read this value in our get method

7) we need to add a parameter to the method :getUser(@PathVariable String userId) 

8) so to add PathVariable we need to do two things:

a) update Get annotation with userId: #####@Get(path="/{useID}")######
b) Update parameter for get method will @PathVariable and pass String UserID:
######getUser(@PathVariable String userId)######
