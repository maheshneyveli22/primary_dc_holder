1) We are going to use a Utility class in UserServiceImpl

2) Utility class reference will be passed as reference to UserServiceImpl and that will be set

3) To wire this and do constructor based dependancy injection, we should add @Autowired annotation to the UserServiceImpl with utility class parameter

eg:
	@Autowired
	public UserServiceImpl(Utils utils)
	{
		this.utils=utils;
	}

4) for spring to create instance of the Utility classi.e inject Utility class into UserServiceImpl, in Utility class we should add annotation @Service

eg:
@Service
public class Utils {
