1) Query string is to getusers based on a condition. this will still return collection but based on certain condition

2) Query String indicated by adding question mark(?) as part of the url. whatever comes after ?, will be query string
eg: http://wwww.yourWebsiteAddress.com/api/users/?start=1&limit=50

3) Multiple parameters of query string can eb passed in url via & symbol

4) SO the first query string parameter will have ? and the second and remaining query string parameters will have & symbol

5) Now to accept query string parameter along with users, we need to create new method getUsers and pass the query string parameters
using @RequestParam annotation as parameter

	public String getUsers(@RequestParam int pageId, @RequestParam int limit)
