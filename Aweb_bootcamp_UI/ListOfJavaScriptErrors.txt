LIST OF ERRORS:
1) Uncaught ReferenceError: "command" is not defined 
2) VM1264:1 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'color')
3) VM1408:1 Uncaught TypeError: Failed to execute 'getElementsByTagName' on 'Document': 1 argument required, but only 0 present.
4) VM7921:2 Uncaught TypeError: houseKeeper1.clean is not a function


1) Uncaught ReferenceError: "command" is not defined 
-> it means that Javascipt throws error and tells: "say" keyword is not a real instruction 

eg:
say("mahesh");
VM191:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: say is not defined
    at <anonymous>:1:1
	
	
2) 
eg code: document.getElementsByTagName("li").style.color ="purple";

VM1264:1 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'color')
    at <anonymous>:1:49
	
->This error will be thrown if javascript is not able to find the element and when we try to set the property for that html element 	

-> The above code getElementsByTagName gives us the array with all three list items 
--> SInce we are trying to set the style property for this array it is throwing error 
-> hence to solve this issue we need to select the item in the array that we want to change 

eg:
document.getElementsByTagName("li")[2].style.color ="yellow";

-> Here in the array, when we specify the exact element in array by specifying the index, the issue is solved 


3) 

eg code: document.getElementsByTagName()


VM1408:1 Uncaught TypeError: Failed to execute 'getElementsByTagName' on 'Document': 1 argument required, but only 0 present.
    at <anonymous>:1:10
	
Root cause:
This error occurs, if we dont supply sufficient arguments for method, this method wants 1 argument, but we dont supply anything

Solution:
By passing the required argument we can solve this issue 

document.getElementsByClassName("btn")


4) is not a function



var houseKeeper1 = new HouseKeeper(12, "James", ["bedroom"]);
houseKeeper1.clean();
VM7921:2 Uncaught TypeError: houseKeeper1.clean is not a function
    at <anonymous>:2:14
	
	
Root cause:
-> When we try to access a method of an object which does not exist in constructor 

Solution:
-> Add the method in the constructor and retry
