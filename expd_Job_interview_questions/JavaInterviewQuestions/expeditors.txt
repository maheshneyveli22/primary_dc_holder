1. Java memory models
2. One interface many implementation - Spring annotation
3. @DependsOn for telling dependant objects
4. @Lazy loads only when needed
5. Static variables in memory
6. Composite key in hibernate 
7. FailSafe no concurrent modification exception. Eg:CopyOnWriteArrayList, ConcurrentHashMap
8. Top 5 concurrent collections
a) Concurrent Hashmap - alternative to Hashtable, SynchronisedMap

b) CopyOnWriteArrayList,CopyOnWriteArraySet
c) Blockingqueue - To solve producer consumer problem, put() , take()
I) ArrayBlockingQueue
II) LinkedBlockingQueue
III) PriorityBlockingQueue to process elements on order other than FIFO
d) Dequeue - Insertion and removal at both ends of the queue.
It's concurrent implementation - ArrayDeque,LinkedBlockingDequeue

e) ConcurrentSkipListMap and ConcurrentSkipListSet -concurrent alternative for Synchronised version of SortedMap and SortedSet
