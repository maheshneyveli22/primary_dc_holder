1) What are the 3 technologies used to create 
website:
a) HTML
-> Creates content of website 
-> Creates all buttons, text and images 
b) CSS
-> Changes appearance of website 
-> Can make our website look nice 
c) Javascript 
-> Makes website interactive 

-> if we have only html and css, and click one of 
these buttons,website does not do anything 
-> We need javascript to make the page more interactive 




2) What is Javascript?
-> Giving instructions to a computer and then 
-> Computer follows our instructions 

3) Order of operations
a) * / are done first
b) + - are done after

-> order of operations is also called Operator 
precedence in javascript
-> * / have same priority. if both are in single line
then it is calculated from left to right
-> Similarly for + - 


c) When using brackets, javascript first 
does calculations in brackets first and then outside the 
brackets 

eg: (1+1) *3 = 2*3= 6

d) Brackets have highest priority in order of operations

1. (..)
2. * /
3. + -
