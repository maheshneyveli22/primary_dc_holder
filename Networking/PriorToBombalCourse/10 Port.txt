1) 
-> IP:With an IP address, we can determine in which network we are 
-> MAC: With MAC address, we can determine in which computer we are in that particular network 
-> PORT: To determine which application or service runs in that particular computer . Also we use port in NAT's PAT and Port forwarding 

2) 
Using one internet connection, we will run multiple service/application . To data go to particular service or application we will use ports

3) Port number range:

a) Well Known ports: 0-1023
eg: FTP - 20,21 , ssh-22 , Mail -25, DNS -53, HTTP - 80 , HTTPS -  443
b) Registered Ports: 1024-49151
-> some companies would have registered these ports
-> eg: Windows RDP - 3389

c) Random Ports 49152-65535
-> if your computer is going to do some service, it takes port from this range and randomly uses it 


4) Lets take two webservers : Webserver 1 and Webserver 2 
To Webserver1, HTTP web page is there . Hence Webserver 1 is in listening mode in port 80. If anyone asks for http web page to Webserver1, it will come via port 80 and webserver1, will respond via this port 80 
To Webserver2, HTTPS web page is there . Hence Webserver 2 is in listening mode in port 443. If anyone asks for https web page to Webserver2, it will come via port 443 and webserver2, will respond via this port 443


5) Advantages of ports:
a) Data traffic does not collapse since we use different ports for each purpose or service
b)  Security : webserver 2, is in listening mode only in port 443 and all other ports are closed , Similarly in our system also if all open ports are blocked via firewall , then only required service will go from our system . If any request comes via blocked port, rquest will be blocked 



6) Port Forwarding: 


7) Practical 
http://www.vulnweb.com/ or http://www.vulnweb.com:80 -> page will open. for other ports page wont be loaded 


https://www.google.com/ or https://www.google.com:443 -> page will open. for other ports page wont be loaded


8) To determine, Source ports used in windows :

Resource Monitor -> Network tab -> TCP connections

-> Here it will show via internet what all traffic we are handling will be shown
