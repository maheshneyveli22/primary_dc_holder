4.0) 
Consider the following hierarchy:

content_copy
<parent-component>
  <child-component></child-component>
</parent-component>
The <parent-component> serves as the context for the <child-component>.

@Input() and @Output() give a child component a way to communicate with its parent component. 
@Input() lets a parent component update data in the child component. 
Conversely, @Output() lets the child send data to a parent component.

4) Passing property from Parent component to child component
-> While property binding happens automatically from Parent to child for html properties, we must use @Input for property binding from Parent to child component

a) Using @Input decorator
b) To watch for changes on an @Input() property, use OnChanges, one of Angular's lifecycle hooks

-> Example
###########
1) CONFIGURING CHILD COMPONENT
a) decorate the property with @Input() in child component 
export class ItemDetailComponent {
  @Input() item = ''; // decorate the property with @Input()
}

b) displaying data fetched from parent component 
src/app/item-detail/item-detail.component.html
content_copy
<p>
  Today's item: {{item}}
</p>

2) CONFIGURING PARENT COMPONENT
a) The next step is to bind the property in the parent component's template. In this example, the parent component template is app.component.html.
b) Use the child's selector, here <app-item-detail>, as a directive within the parent component template.
c) Use property binding to bind the item property in the child to the currentItem property of the parent.

src/app/app.component.html
content_copy
<app-item-detail [item]="currentItem"></app-item-detail>
In the parent component class, designate a value for currentItem:

---> Here [item] is the custom property to which we need to pass value from Parent to child component
--> [item] is the property which we have defined using @Input in child component 

src/app/app.component.ts
content_copy
export class AppComponent {
  currentItem = 'Television';
}
With @Input(), Angular passes the value for currentItem to the child so that item renders as Television.
