2) 

main.ts -> we can specify the bootstrap module to start the application
Node.js -> Node.js is an open source server environment
package.json -> contains all modules and dependencies
angular.json -> contains info on outputPath, index.html location, main.ts etc 


3) 
ng build -> builds and deploys the angular application
ng serve -> builds and serves application for any change detected 

4) node.js acts as webserver for angular applications 
-> NodeJS server and the Angular application run on two different ports in the development phase, making it easier and faster to implement while developing an application. 
-> For example, in the development phase, we can say that with the help of the webpack dev server, 
   AngularJS application is running on port 4200, whereas the NodeJS server is running on port no. 3080.
