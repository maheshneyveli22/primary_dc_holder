1) TLS is a protocol for the secure transmission of data based on SSLv3. It offers confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. 
Confidentiality: hides the content of the messages
Integrity: detects when the messages have been tampered with
Authentication: ensures that whoever is sending them is who he says he is.
Additionally, it detects missing and duplicated messages.

2) TLS is the primary way to secure web traffic and is mostly used for that purpose. A whole lot of pages trust that TLS is secure (from the smallest online shop to Facebook), that is why things like POODLE and Heartbleed receive so much press.

3) If you are really interested in these subjects Iâ€™d recommend researching:

AES
Block ciphers modes of operation
Cryptographic hashes
SHA-2
HMAC
Key exchange
Diffie-Hellman
Public key cryptography

4) CONFIDENTIALITY:
For confidentiality TLS uses AES with several modes available (CBC, CCM, GCM).

5) For key exchange either Diffie-Hellman (elliptic curve mode supported) or RSA are available. With the whole Heartbleed debacle, it is now recommended to use a key exchange mechanism with forward secrecy, which implies Diffie-Hellman in this case.

6) For integrity HMAC is commonly used, today is pretty much mandatory to use SHA256.
