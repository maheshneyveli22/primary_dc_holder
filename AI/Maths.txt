--> Vector is an array of numbers written either in row form or column form  


1  2
3  4 

---> Matrix is a 2d array in which rows and columns are there 



1 2       1 5 
3 4		  7	9 

1 3       2 4 
9 4       7 1

--> Tensor is n dimensional array with n more than 2  


2) Importance of Linear Algebra:
-> Linear Algebra has a faster computation speed in dealing with any type of problem 
-> It helps to understand the insights and background behind various types of algorithms used in latest technologies. 
-> It helps us in decison making 


3) Matrices: nXm 

a) Square Matrix: 
-> No of rows and columns are equal 

-> left to right diagonal elements are called Principal diagonal elements of matrix 


b) Row and Column matrix: 
-> Matrix that has only one row is called row matrix 
-> Matrix that has only one column is called column matrix 

c) Singleton matrix: 
-> Matrix that has one element in it is called singleton matrix 


d) Zero/Null Matrix:
-> If all entries in matrix are zero, it is called zero or null matrix 


e) Diagonal Matrix: 
-> Matrix that has non zero entries only in diagonal elements is called Diagonal matrix . 
-> All non diagonal elements will be zero 

Diagonal matrix is a square matrix 


f) Scalar matrix:

2  1  0             0	9  8
2  2  3             0   0  7



i) Equivalence Matrices :
-> Two matrices are equivalent if their order is same 


j) Equal Matrices:
-> Two matrices are equal if their corresponding entries are same. 
-> Equal matrices should be an equivalence matrices. 

k) Transpose of a matrix:
-> If we convert a matrix : row into columns or column into rows - then the matrix we obtain is called transpose of a matrix 

l) Symmetric and Skew Symmetric matrices 

[Aij] = [Aji]

-> This means that if i transpose a matrix and if both the matrices are same matrices it is called Symmetric matrix 


[Aij]=-[Aji]

-> If i transpose a matrix and if the resulting matrix is negative of original matrix then it is called skew symmetric matrix 


4)Operations on Matrices 

a) Operation of matrices include Addition, Subtraction and multiplication of Matrices 


b) Addition of Matrices 
-> Two matrices can be added only if they are of the same order[rows=columns]

b.1) Properties of matrix  Addition: 

1) Commutative law: A+B = B+A
2) Associative law: A+(B+C)= (A+B)+C 
3) A + 0 = 0 + A = A ( Additive Identity existence ) where 0 is null matrix 
4) A+ (-A) = 0 (Existence of Additive inverse) 
5) If A+B = B+C ->  then A= C 



c) Matrix multiplication and its properties 
c.1) Scalar multiplication 

If A ->   1 2 
          3 4
		  
Then 2A -> 2 4
	       6 8 


c.2) In multiplication of two matrices, no of colums in matrix 1 should always be equal to no of rows in matrix 2 

If A has order :3x2 and B has order: 2x3, then the product will be of order: 3x3 

c.3) Sclar multiplication: 
K(A+B) =K(A+B) 
k,l   (K+L)=KA+LA 


C.4) Multiplication of matrices : 
   AB != BA 
   A(BC) = (AB)C -> Associative law 
   A(B+C) = AB+AC -> Distributive law applicable 
   
Here -> indicates order 

 A -> mxn
 B -> nxp
 C -> nxp , then distributive law is appliable 
 
 
 c.5) Unit matrix 
 
 I2 -> 1 0
	   0 1

 I3 -> 1 0 0 
       0 1 0 
	   0 0 1



5) Properties of Transpose of Matrices : 

´  Indicates Transpose of a matrix 

-> Transpose of a matrix means : convert rows into columns and columns into rows. 

-> If A and B are two matrices ,
 Then :
 a) ( A ± B)´ = A´ ±  B´ 
 b) (A´)´ = A
 c) (AB)´ = B´A´



6) Hermitian Matrices and Skew Hermitian Matrices 

a) Hermitian Matrix: 
-> The hermitian matrix has complex numbers as its elements, and it is equal to its conjugate transpose matrix.

-> Hermitian matrix is a square matrix, which is equal to its conjugate transpose matrix. 
-> Non diagonal elements of hermitian matrix are complex numbers 


a.1) Hermitian Matrix of Order 2 x 2:
-> Here the non-diagonal elements  are complex numbers. 
-> Only the first element of the first row and the second element of the second row are real numbers. 
-> Also, the complex number of the first-row second element is a conjugate complex number of the second-row first element.

eg:


  3			3-2i 
                
 3-2i		 2   
 
 

a.2) Hermitian Matrix of Order 3 x 3

-> Here also the non-diagonal elements are all complex numbers. 
-> The elements connecting the diagonal from the first row first element to the third-row third element are all real numbers. 
-> Also, notice that an element in the position (i, j) is the complex conjugate of the element in the position (j, i). 
-> For example, in the matrix below, 2 + i is present in the first row and the second column, whereas it's conjugate 2 - i is present in the second row and first column. 
-> The same is the case with other complex numbers as well.


1		2+i		5-4i
2-i		 4       6i
5+4i	-6i      2 



a.3) Hermitian Matrix Formula
-> From the above two matrices, it is clear that the diagonal elements of a Hermitian matrix are always real. 
-> Also, the element in the position (i, j) is the complex conjugate of the element in the position (j, i).

    _
A= (A´)


b) Skew Hermitian Matrix: 
-> A matrix will be known as the skew-Hermitian matrix if there is a square matrix in which the negation of the matrix and its conjugate transpose matrix are similar to each other, 

i.e., A^H = -A

or 
         ___
[Aij]= -[Aji]

-> Here AH is used to indicate the conjugate transpose of matrix A. It can also be indicated by the symbol A*

-> Thus by definition: A square matrix A=[Aij] is called skew Hermitian matrix, if for all i and j, 


[Aij]= -[Aji]


b.1) 2x2:

   xi   y+zi 

-y+zi    wi 


-> Here x,y,z are used to indicate real numbers 


b.2) 3x3 

   ai		b+ci		c+di 
-b+ci		 ei 		g+hi 
-c+di      -g+hi 		  ki 

b.3) Properties of skew hermitian matrix: 

-> The diagonal entries are either purely imaginary or zero.
-> Elements other than diagonal elements may have real as well as imaginary parts.
-> The imaginary part of the ith row and jth column, other than diagonal elements, is the same.
-> The real part of the ith row and jth column, other than diagonal elements, is the same but have opposite signs.

b.4) 

--> Aij 
i		2+3i		2+i 
-(2-3i)   0          5i
-(2-i)    5i		 2i

  
  
-> Aji 


i		-(2-3i)		-(2-i) 
2+3i 		0		  5i 
2+i 	    5i        2i 


-> Aij 


-i		-(2+3i)		-(2+i) 
-2-3i      0          -5i 
-2-i 	   -5i        -2i 
    
	_____
-> -[Aji]

i		2+3i		2+i 
-(2-3i)   0          5i 
-(2-i)    5i         2i


-> Hence it is an example of skew hermitian matrix 



7) Determinants:
-> A square matrix will have its own determinant

-> While matrix is an arrangement. Determinant will have its own value 

a) Determinant for matrix A is written as:

det A or |A|

b) For Matrix A of order 2x2 


1	2 
3	4

det A  = 1x4-2x3 
	   = 4-6
	   = -2
	   
	   
c) for matrix A of order 3x3 

2	3	0
-1  0   5
1   2  -3


2 -> 0   5   -3 -> -1   5    +0-> -1  0 
     2  -3          1  -3          1  2
	 
	 
-> =2[0-10]-3[3-5]+0[-2-0]
= -20+6+0
= -14 


d) Now in above example we took determinant using value of rows, similarly we can get determinant using value of columns 


2	3	0
-1  0   5
1   2  -3


d.1) 

2 -> 0	 5   -(-1)-> 3	 0  +1->3	0
     2  -3           2  -3		0   5
	 
= 2[0-10]+1[-9-0]+1[15-0]
= -20-9+15
= -14


e) Thus we can take row or column  and we will get same value as determinant 


8) Minors and Cofactors of elements in a determinant: 

a) Consider a determinant for 2x2 matrix 


a.1) Minor for 2x2 matrix 
1	2
3	4

-> The minor for the element 1 : M11 is , Leaving colum which has 1 and row which has element 1 , we will get Minor M11 as: 4
-> The minor for the element 2 : M12 is, 3
-> The minor for the element 3 : M21 is, 2 
-> The minor for the element 4 : M22 is, 1 


a.2) To these minors we obtain the cofactors by assigning the signs 
-> for a 2x2 matrix we give sign as:

+	-
-	+ 


a.3) So the cofactors will be:
M11=4		C11=  4
M12=3		C12= -3
M21=2       C21= -2 
M22=1		C22=  1



b) For a 3x3 matrix: 

1	2	-1
0	1	 5
1	2	-1

Scheme for cofactor in 3x3 matrix:

+	-	+
-	+	-
+	- 	+ 


M11 -> 1	 5 -> Whose determinant is = -1-10 = -11 ,		C11= -11
       2	-1 
	   
M12 -> 0     5 -> Whose determinant is = 0-5=-5,		C12= 5 
	   1    -1
	   
M13 -> 0	1 -> Whose determinant is 0-1= -1, 			C13= -1  
	   1	2 
	   
-> Like this we can find all the minors and cofactors of 3x3 matrix 

9)Properties of Determinants: 
a) If we interchange rows and columns of a determinant, then its value remains unchanged. 
-> True for 2x2 as well as 3x3 matrix / determinant 
b) If we change 2 rows or 2 columns of a determinant, value of the determinant remains same but its sign is changed. 
->  True for 2x2 as well as 3x3 matrix/ determinant
c) If any 2 rows or 2 columns of a determinant are same, then the value of that determinant will be zero 

eg: 
1	1
5	5 

1	5	2
2  -1	0
2  -1	0 

d) If we multiply all elements,of any row or any column  by k, where k is real number, Then the value of the determinant becomes k times the original value 


-> Suppose a 2x2 matrx :

1	 5
2	-1

d.1) Its determinat is -1=10 = -11 

d.2) Suppose if i multiply first column by 2, 


2	 5 
4	-1 

Then its determinant is: -2-20= -22 
-> Thus the determinant is k times the original value 

e) If we have determinant of form : 

a1+ λ1		a2+λ2		a3+λ3      =    a1			  a2 		  λ3   +    λ1		      λ2		  λ3
b1			  b2		  b3            b1			  b2		  b3        b1			  b2		  b3
c1			  c2		  c3            c1			  c2		  c3        c1			  c2		  c3

->
