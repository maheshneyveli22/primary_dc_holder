....

Open your favorite text editor, such as Visual Studio Code, and navigate to the file that has merge conflicts.

To see the beginning of the merge conflict in your file, search the file for the conflict marker <<<<<<<. When you open the file in your text editor, you'll see the changes from the HEAD or base branch after the line <<<<<<< HEAD. Next, you'll see =======, which divides your changes from the changes in the other branch, followed by >>>>>>> BRANCH-NAME. In this example, one person wrote "open an issue" in the base or HEAD branch and another person wrote "ask your question in IRC" in the compare branch or branch-a.

If you have questions, please
<<<<<<< HEAD
open an issue
=======
ask your question in IRC.
>>>>>>> branch-a
Decide if you want to keep only your branch's changes, keep only the other branch's changes, or make a brand new change, which may incorporate changes from both branches. Delete the conflict markers <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>> and make the changes you want in the final merge. In this example, both changes are incorporated into the final merge:

If you have questions, please open an issue or ask in our IRC channel if it's more urgent.
Add or stage your changes.

git add .
Commit your changes with a comment.

git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict by incorporating both suggestions"
You can now merge the branches on the command line or push your changes to your remote repository on GitHub and merge your changes in a pull request.
